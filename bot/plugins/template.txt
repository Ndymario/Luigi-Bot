So, you want to write some code for NSMB DS?

To get started, check out the NSMB Code Template, along side the NSMB Code Reference, using the buttons below.

Keep in mind that the old template, created by Dirbaio, is now outdated. As such, support for code mods will only be given for code written in the new template.
